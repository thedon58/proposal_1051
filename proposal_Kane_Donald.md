# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Philadelphia Invaders

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

I am working on making a Space Invaders game where Stella must fight off the invasion from other schools around Philadelphia to protect campus.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I would like to set up my project so that it is actually Space Invaders with Stella shooting at the mascots from Saint Joe's, Villanova, UPenn, Penn State, and Drexel. I plan on making my software allow the program to run with the 'villains' randomly attacking the user. I want the game to work, but I also want it to be more of a challenge than just shooting different logos. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

+ Works Properly
+ images are legible
+ game theme of Philadelphia is clear

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

+ Works Properly
+ Images are legible
+ Game theme of Philadelphia is clear
+ Sounds are accurate and work properly
+ Use different places on campus to "save"

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

+ Works Properly
+ Images are legible
+ Game theme of Philadelphia is clear
+ Sounds are accurate and work properly
+ Use different places on campus to "save"
+ AI to help make the game more challenging
+ Multiple levels
+ Multiple Difficulties


## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Based on my plans for my game, my first step will be to get better accimilated with coding in lua. This obviously will be done with watching the videos provided for us by the cs50 course from Harvard. I definitely need to continue to get better with using a different language, but my main focus right now would be learning the comands to simulate the physics of the game.
